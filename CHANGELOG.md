# Changelog

## [1.1.0]

- Texts on the screen and on the pages say "e-reader" instead of "Kindle", since the plugin runs on other e-readers too. The screenshots `.zip` is now called `screenshots.zip`.
- The screen with the QR code says the address can also be typed in any browser, on a computer too.
- Download All no longer freezes the request: the page says the `.zip` is being prepared and the download starts by itself when it is ready, while the e-reader shows the same message.
- The firewall rules accept only private networks, and a port left open by a crash is closed as soon as KOReader starts again.
- The power button now works with the screen open: the e-reader sleeps, and the transfer stops. The screen keeps the e-reader awake the way KOReader's own auto suspend does, instead of the setting that also blocked the power button.
- Book Drop and other plugins that keep the e-reader awake no longer let it sleep in the middle of each other's work.
- A screen that cannot open shows a message instead of closing KOReader, and stops everything it had started.
- The Back button closes the screen, on e-readers with buttons.
- Nothing is painted over the sleep screen while the e-reader sleeps.
- A connection that sends nothing is no longer closed for the time the e-reader screen was busy.

## [1.0.2]

- The Book Drop cover on the sleep screen while the plugin is open.

## [1.0.1]

- The approval question closes when sharing stops, and a tap outside it no longer counts as Deny.
- The device in use keeps its own connections, so other devices on the network cannot take them.
- The screenshots `.zip` is reused while the screenshots stay the same, checks free space first, and is never served incomplete.
- Covers and downloads no longer walk the whole books folder, and a received book no longer makes the screen read it again.
- Updates on the e-reader screen no longer flash the whole screen each time.
- Less memory per cover, and books without a cover are not opened again.
- Faster transfers, with several connections moving in the same moment.
- An upload refused while it is being sent now shows the reason instead of "connection lost".
- The length of a download comes from the file itself.
- Errors in requests go to KOReader's log.

## [1.0.0]

First public release.

- Send books to the device from a browser, one or many at a time, with progress for each file.
- Download books, in a grid with covers or in a list, and screenshots, one by one or all in a `.zip`.
- A QR code to connect, with no app to install on the other device.
- One device at a time, approved on the screen of the e-reader.
- A screen that shows who is connected and what was received.
- The device stays awake while the screen is open, so a transfer is not cut short.
- In English, Portuguese and Spanish, following KOReader's language, on the device and in the browser.
